SSU 0.6:

	* Revision syntax now supports date/times.

	* Exit status is now compatible with diff(1).

	* checkout speed improvements.


SSU 0.5: Sat Mar 05 CET 2005

	* Fixed several long-standing command-line escaping issues on ssserv
	  (almost all operations affected, upgrade highly recommended).

	* checkin/add now spawn an editor when no comments are specified on the
          command line.

	* -r (reopen) flag implemented for revert.

	* cat, label and diff can now refer to old file versions.

	* Implemented diff2.

	* Minor cleanups.


SSU 0.4: Sat Feb 26 CET 2005

	* Manual get of a single new file would fail with an error.

	* Recursive diff would stop on the first writable file with no error.

	* "checkin" no longer adds new files to the repository: the
          functionality has been moved to the "add" command.

	* Addition of a new file was not an atomic operation (the resulting
          file could end-up in a different project under heavy server usage).

	* delete can be forced in some circumstances.

	* ssserv stability improvements.

	* Minor cleanups.

	SSU 0.3 clients can communicate with 0.4 as long the new
	functionalities are not involved (add/delete).


SSU 0.3: Fri Feb 18 CET 2005

	* Implemented "label" and "cat".

	* Fixed the .ssrc search mechanism (extended to 5 levels).

	* Addition of files in new sub-projects would fail with an error.

	* Removed extra redundant checks in the protocol for latency
          improvements. **WARNING**: this is a protocol-incompatible
          release. Both the client and the server needs to be upgraded.

	* Minor cleanups.
